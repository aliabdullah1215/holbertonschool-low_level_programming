# C - Variadic functions

## üìå Description
This project is part of the Holberton School low-level programming curriculum.  
It focuses on **variadic functions** in C ‚Äî functions that accept a variable number of arguments (like `printf`).  

We learn how to use the macros from `<stdarg.h>`:
- `va_list`
- `va_start`
- `va_arg`
- `va_end`

and also the importance of the `const` type qualifier.
