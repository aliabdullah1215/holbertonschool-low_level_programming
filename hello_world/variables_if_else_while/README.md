# Variables, if, else, while

This project is part of the **Holberton School** low-level programming curriculum.  
It introduces the basics of using variables, conditional statements (`if`, `if...else`), and loops (`while`) in C.

- Differentiate between arithmetic, logical, and relational operators
- Work with the concept of TRUE and FALSE in C
- Use the `while` loop to iterate
- Print values using `printf`
- Understand the ASCII character set
- Compile C programs with specific `gcc` flags (`-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`)
