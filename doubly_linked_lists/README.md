# C - Doubly linked lists

## üìñ Description
This project is part of the **Holberton School Low Level Programming** curriculum.  
It focuses on understanding and implementing **doubly linked lists** in the C programming language.

A **doubly linked list** is a type of data structure that consists of nodes linked together in a sequence.  
Each node contains:
- An integer data (`n`)
- A pointer to the **previous** node (`prev`)
- A pointer to the **next** node (`next`)

This project helps you understand how to create, traverse, add, and delete nodes in such lists efficiently.

## üß† Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

- What is a doubly linked list  
- How to use doubly linked lists in C  
- How to traverse a list in both directions  
- How to properly manage memory allocation (`malloc`, `free`)  
- How to write clean, readable, and well-documented C code following the **Betty style**
